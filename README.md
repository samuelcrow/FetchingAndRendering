# FetchingAndRendering
## Fetching and Rendering Description  
This is a simple project that I made through the MIT | xPro course.  It demonstrates our abilities to create a fully functional website that draws in data from an external source, and displays it on a website.  For this website, I built a weather application.  If you want to check the weather, search up a city in the search bar, press submit, and the weather for the next 3 days will appear.
